# Creating a Credential

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching Jobs against machines, synchronizing 
with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without actually exposing the credential 
to the user. If you have a user move to a different team or leave the organization, you donâ€™t have to re-key 
all of your systems just because that credential was available in Tower.
